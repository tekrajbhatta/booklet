## Features

    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser**:

## Usage

- **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the book. Modify the content within the `<div class="book">` element to change the book's content.

- **CSS**: The `styles.css` file contains the styles for the book. You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS classes.
